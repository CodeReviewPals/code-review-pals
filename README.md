Code Review Pals is a community-driven platform for code review, designed to help developers learn from each other and improve their skills by providing a place to share their code and get feedback from peers.

Our goal is to encourage developers of all levels to submit their code for review and to foster a supportive and collaborative environment where senior developers can help juniors learn and grow. We believe that code review is a vital part of the software development process, and that it helps improve code quality, catch bugs and security issues, and share knowledge.
