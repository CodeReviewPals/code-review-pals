Sure, here's a possible description for the project's README.md on GitHub:
Code Review Pals

Code Review Pals is a community-driven platform for code review, designed to help developers learn from each other and improve their skills by providing a place to share their code and get feedback from peers.

Our goal is to encourage developers of all levels to submit their code for review and to foster a supportive and collaborative environment where senior developers can help juniors learn and grow. We believe that code review is a vital part of the software development process, and that it helps improve code quality, catch bugs and security issues, and share knowledge.


If you're interested in contributing to Code Review Pals, please check out the [Issues](https://github.com/geeksesi/code-review-pals/issues) and join our community. Together, we can make code review a more accessible and rewarding experience for everyone.
